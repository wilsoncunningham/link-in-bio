      <h1>Hello readers</h1>
      <p>Recently, I've taken up the hobby of reading in my free time. I had been keeping a journal of the books I'm reading for my own personal pleasure,
        but why not publish it? So, here are my (very informal) reviews of the books I have recently read.

          	How do we know what we are told is true? What happens when you go against everyone around you? Authoritarianism, suppression, truth, surveillance. In the second half of the book, we see Winston’s terrible torture and decay. We see a man completely crushed. His mind is chewed up, swallowed, and spat out again into something entirely different. At the end of the book, Winston is not even a shell of what he once was.
            <br>
            I had previously though that people only liked 1984 because it calls out surveillance, totalitarianism, and fake news. These things only scrape the surface of the novel. Great read overall.
